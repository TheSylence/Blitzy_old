			<!-- ====================== MANUAL =================== -->
			<div id="manual">
				<h1>Blitzy manual </h1>
				<p>
					Welcome to the Blitzy manual. In this document you will find every information that
					you need to know about Blitzy in order to use it and even more. This manual was
					written for Blitzy 1.0.0. If you are viewing this document online please make sure
					that you have the latest version of Blitzy installed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The manual written for the version you have installed is located in the "docs" folder
					of your Blitzy installation. To make sure the information is correct please refer
					to the document that came with the version you installed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<!-- ====================== REQUIREMENTS =================== -->
			<div id="requirements">
				<h1>System requirements </h1>
				<p>
					To use Blitzy you will need:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Windows Vista or newer (64bit) with the latest Service Pack installed</li>
					<li>.NET Framework 4.5.1</li>
					<li>Some free space on one of your hard disks</li>
					<li>Some free space on your system disk (*)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Please don't ask me for other specs like CPU speed or RAM. To be honest, I
					don't know them and I don't have enough computers to test this. However, if your
					computer can run Windows it probably is also able to run Blitzy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh and yes I do <strong>not</strong> support Windows XP! If you managed to get Blitzy to run under XP
					that's good for you. However don't expect any support if you encounter problems that are
					specific to XP.
				</p>
				<p>
					(*): Blitzy stores its settings and the catalog in the appdata folder. By default this folder is
					stored on your primary hard disk (the one Windows is installed on).
					The exact amount of space needed depends on how big your catalog is and what plugins you have installed.
					However I doubt you will need more than 20 or 30 MB of space for your catalog and settings.
				</p>
			</div>
			<!-- ====================== INSTALLATION =================== -->
			<div id="installation">
				<h1>Installation</h1>
				<p>
					Installing Blitzy is pretty straight forward. After downloading the setup file from
					the website all you have to do is double clicking the file. Then the setup wizard
					will open and guide you through the installation process.
					After the wizard finished you may start using Blitzy.
				</p>
			</div>
			<!-- ====================== USING BLITZY =================== -->
			<div id="using">
				<h1>Using Blitzy</h1>
				<p>
					Blitzy was designed to be as easy and fast to use as possible. And if you used other keystroke launchers in the past, working
					with Blitzy should be as easy as eating a pancake.
				</p>
				<p>
					To bring up Blitzy's window you have to press the shortcut you defined in the settings. (The default shortcut is Ctrl+Alt+Space)
					You can do this from anywhere and not just from the desktop, browser, or your mail client.
					However be sure to use a shortcut that will not interfer with shortcuts used by applications you try
					to open Blitzy from. Also it is recommended to use a shortcut that is not used globally by other applications.
				</p>
				<div id="commands">
					<h2>Entering commands</h2>
					<p>
						To enter a command you simply start typing. Blitzy will display a list of suggestions from which you can choose using the cursor keys (up and down).
						By pressing the return key Blitzy will execute the command that is currently selected.
						Additionally you may execute a command from the list by double clicking the desired one.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Tip:</em> You don't need to type in the whole command. When the item you want to execute is selected you can simply press
						the return key and the command will be executed, independent of what is currently typed into the input box.
						You may even have some spelling errors. The only thing that matters is that the command you want to execute is selected.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some commands may require or offer additional parameters to be entered. To do so enter the command and press the tabulator key.
						Then simply type as many parameters as the command needs (each separated with another tabulator) and press the return key when
						you are done.
						Each parameter will be separated by an arrow and most of the commands should indicate if they need more parameters and what kind
						of parameters they require.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong> Commands are executed in the background. This means, that depending on how much time the execution of the
						command takes, you may have to wait until you see the action.
						However this has the advantage that you can execute a new command right after the previous command was started. You don't have to wait
						until the previous command finishes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Blitzy has the ability to learn what commands you use often and places items you use more often on top of the suggestion list.
						So the longer you use Blitzy, the less you have to type since the command you want to execute is already placed on top!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="admin_commands">
					<h2>Executing commands with elevated rights</h2>
					<p>
						Blitzy has the ability to execute commands with elevated rights (a.k.a. as an administrator).
						To do so you need to have access to the account of an administrator on your local machine.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want to execute a command with elevated rights you simply need to type in the command as you would normally do
						and select the right command from the command list.
						After that, hold Ctrl and Shift while pressing return. Whatever command you select will be executed with elevated rights.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong> Executing some commands with elevated is useless and therefor disabled. For example: There is no benefit in rebuilding
						the catalog with administrative rights. In fact, the UAC prompt (if enabled) won't even pop up for certain commands.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="predefined_commands">
					<h2>Predefined commands</h2>
					<p>
						There are some commands built into Blitzy that can be used no matter what plugins are installed or not.
						Below you can find a list of all these commands:
					</p>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Command</th>
								<th>Description</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>quit</td>
								<td>Exits the application</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>reset</td>
								<td>
									Resets the command execution count. After executing this command the order in which
									commands are listed when you type is reset to default values.
									This can be useful if you messed up the counting, don't longer use a command you previously used or
									you simply want to start over with your ordering.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>catalog</td>
								<td>
									Manually rebuilds the catalog. This can be useful if you added new files to the folders you watch
									but your next automatic rebuild (if enabled) is too far in the future.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>version</td>
								<td>Checks if a newer version of the application is available for download.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>history</td>
								<td>
									Clears the command history. After executing this you won't see any commands in the history window
									until you executed further commands.
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</div>
				<div id="history">
					<h2>Command history</h2>
					<p>
						If you have enabled the history in the <a href="#settings_general">settings</a> you can bring up the
						history view by holding Ctrl while pressing the up or down arrow in the main window.
						All commands that you previously entered are displayed in the list that now shows up.
						By pressing the up or down arrow while holding Ctrl you can navigate through the list.
						If you have found the command you want to enter again, press return while still holding the Ctrl key.
						The selected command will now be inserted into the input field and you can execute the command.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<!-- ====================== CONFIGURE Blitzy =================== -->
			<div id="configuration">
				<h1>Configure Blitzy</h1>
				<p>
					To configure Blitzy and all installed <a href="#plugins">plugins</a> you simply
					click on the settings icon in the <a href="#mainwindow">main window</a>. After doing
					so, a dialog will open where you can configure Blitzy to fit your needs. The dialog
					is divided into several tab items:
				</p>
				<div id="settings_general">
					<h2>General</h2>
					<p>
						In this tab you can edit the general behaviour of Blitzy. The default settings that are installed
						when running Blitzy for the first time should be good enough for most of the users. However, if you
						want to do some fine tuning this is place to go.
					</p>
					<h3>Show tray icon</h3>
					<p>
						This option defines whether you will see the Blitzy icon in the system tray or not.
						The default behaviour is to show the icon.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong> The tray icon is not needed for Blitzy to operate. It is just a reminder for you
						that Blitzy is running and waiting for your input.
					</p>
					<h3>Automatically check for updates</h3>
					<p>
						When this option is enabled (which is the default) Blitzy will check for new versions online
						every time it is started. Of course this requires an internet connection.
					</p>
					<h3>Close when focus is lost</h3>
					<p>
						When this setting is enabled the Blitzy window will disappear if it loses focus, i.e. you click outside
						of the window or activate a different window. The default setting is to hide the window when it loses
						its focus.
					</p>
					<h3>Close on escape</h3>
					<p>
						This option defines whether the Blitzy window will be closed if you press the escape key. The default
						behaviour is to close the window if the escape key is pressed.
					</p>
					<h3>Close after command execution</h3>
					<p>
						When this setting is enabled (which is the default) the Blitzy window will close after you execute a command.
					</p>
					<h3>Keep input content</h3>
					<p>
						When this option is enabled the last executed command will stay in the input field even if the window is closed
						after executing the command. The default behaviour is to clear the input field after a command was executed.
					</p>
					<h3>Always stay on top</h3>
					<p>
						When this setting is enabled (which is the default) the Blitzy window will stay on top of all other windows.
					</p>
					<h3>Hotkey</h3>
					<p>
						This setting defines which key combination will be used to show up the Blitzy window. This always has to be
						a combination of a system key (like Ctrl, Alt or the Windows key) and an ordinary key.
						The default value is Ctrl+Alt+Space
					</p>
					<h3>Max Items</h3>
					<p>
						This is the maximum amount of suggestions that show up in the suggestion window. A higher value is likely to
						slow down the application. A lower value is likely to be less precise. So you should test which value fits your
						needs best.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="settings_folders">
					<h2>Folders</h2>
					<p>
						This tab is where you can configure which folders Blitzy should scan for files that will be listed as commands.
						By default your whole Start Menu will be scanned for applications.
					</p>
					<p>
						To add a new location simply click the &quot;Add&quot;-button below the list of folders and then select the folder
						you want to add.
						Without further configuration all files within the selected folder will be used and the search will not include
						subfolders.
						To include subfolders (and subsubfolders and so on) select the folder you just added and check the &quot;Recursive&quot; checkbox.
					</p>
					<p>
						To fine tune what files should be used from a folder you can use the &quot;Rules&quot; and &quot;Excludes&quot; </br>
						TODO
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="settings_workspaces">
					<h2>Workspaces</h2>
					<p>
						TODO
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="settings_plugins">
					<h2>Plugins</h2>
					<p>
						The plugins tab is where you can disable and enable installed plugins and configure them.
						To enable or disable a plugin you have to select the plugin from the list of available plugins and check or uncheck the
						checkbox on top of the list.<br />
						When you select a plugin from the list, the available settings for the plugin will be displayed and you can change them.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="settings_about">
					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>
						This is the place where you can view who is responsible for all the stuff you might
						already love, view the details about the license, and -- and this is probably the
						number one reason why you would click on this tab -- you can see what version of
						Blitzy you are using and when it was built. If you didn't enabled the automatic
						update check you can check if there is a new version available.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<!-- ====================== PLUGINS =================== -->
			<div id="plugins">
				<h1>Plugins</h1>
				<p>
					Blitzy's capabilities can be extended through plugins.
				</p>
				<p>
					To install a new plugin you have to simply copy the plugin's DLL file into the 'plugin'
					folder of your Blitzy installation (Note: you will probably need administrator rights to do this if you have
					installed Blitzy to the default location). However it could be possible that there are
					more steps needed in order to fully install the plugin. For any further information
					please refer the the author of the plugin you are trying to install.
				</p>
				<p>
					Blitzy is delivered with a couple of plugins by default, so you can decided whether you
					want something to be enabled or not. The plugins that are included with the Blitzy
					installation are listed in the following.
				</p>
				<div id="calcy">
					<h2>Calcy</h2>
					<p>
						Calcy is a plugin that allows you to perform calculation within Blitzy. For
						invoking a Calcy command you simply type:
					</p>
					<div class="listing">
						calcy [tab] expression
					</div>
					<p>
						And while you type the result of the expression you typed in so far will be displayed
						in the info field. Below is a list of functions and constants you can use in your
						expression.
					</p>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Function</th>
								<th>Description</th>
								<th>Example</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>pi </td>
								<td>The value of &pi; </td>
								<td>pi = 3.141...</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>e </td>
								<td>The value of e </td>
								<td>e = 2.718...</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>sin </td>
								<td>Calculates the sine </td>
								<td>sin(pi) = 0</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>cos </td>
								<td>Calculates the cosine </td>
								<td>cos(pi) = -1</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>tan </td>
								<td>Calculates the tangent </td>
								<td>tan(pi) = 0</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>sqrt </td>
								<td>Calculates the square root </td>
								<td>sqrt(4) = 2</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>ln </td>
								<td>Calculates the natural logarithm </td>
								<td>ln(e) = 1</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>log </td>
								<td>Calculates the logarithm </td>
								<td>log(100,10) = 2</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>asin </td>
								<td>Calculates the arcsine </td>
								<td>asin(0.1) = 0.100...</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>acos </td>
								<td>Calculates the arccosine </td>
								<td>acos(0.1) = 1.470...</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>atan </td>
								<td>Calculates the arctangent </td>
								<td>atan(0.1) = 0.099...</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</div>
				<div id="weby">
					<h2>Weby</h2>
					<p>
						Weby is a fast way to search the internet using your preferred search engines. Additionally
						you can simply open any website from the command input. If you want to open - let's
						say wikipedia - you would simply type:
					</p>
					<div class="listing">
						weby [tab] wikipedia.org
					</div>
					<p>
						After a default installation there are some default engines already installed:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>google &ndash; Web search using Google</li>
						<li>wiki &ndash; Look up the term on Wikipedia (English version)</li>
						<li>youtube &ndash; Search a video on YouTube</li>
						<li>bing &ndash; Web searching using Bing</li>
						<li>facebook &ndash; Search for people on Facebook</li>
						<li>wolfram &ndash; Compute something using Wolfram Alpha</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						So if you want to search something using google you would simply type
					</p>
					<div class="listing">
						google [tab] your search term
					</div>
					<p>
						After executing the command your default web browser will open and the results of
						your search will be displayed.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can add your own search engines or remove existing ones in Weby's settings dialog.
					</p>
					<p>
						To add a new engine you would click on the &quot;Add&quot;-button and enter the name, a description (optionally) and the URL of the engine.<br />
						The name must not be empty and must not already exist.<br />
						The description may be left blank but then you won't see any further information when entering the command into the input field.<br />
						The URL is the place where Weby should take you after executing the command.<br />
						If you want to pass the search term you entered to the
						website simply put a {0} at the place in the URL where the search term needs to be.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="medy">
					<h2>Medy</h2>
					<p>
						Medy let's you control any media player on your system that supports media keys.
						Media keys are the extra keys on keyboards that allow you to play media, pause them,
						or walk through the playlist. Medy simply simulates a press of these keys so there
						are no compatibility issues with other software.
					</p>
					<p>
						Available commands are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>play &ndash; Tell the player to start playing</li>
						<li>pause &ndash; Tell the player to pause playing</li>
						<li>next &ndash; Tell the player to go to the next track</li>
						<li>prev &ndash; Tell the player to go to the previous track</li>
						<li>volup &ndash; Increase volume</li>
						<li>voldn &ndash; Decrease volume</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						So if you want to pause the currently playing song you simply execute
					</p>
					<div class="listing">
						medy [tab] pause
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="putty">
					<h2>Putty</h2>
					<p>
						Using this plugin you can directly start a Putty session from Blitzy. If you saved
						sessions in Putty they will be directly available inside Blitzy. If you simply want
						to start Putty to start a new session from there, you would simply type:
					</p>
					<div class="listing">
						ssh
					</div>
					<p>
						However, if you want to directly connect to a host you saved using Putty you would
						type:
					</p>
					<div class="listing">
						ssh [tab] session-name
					</div>
					<p>
						Note that instead of typing <em>"ssh"</em> you may also type <em>"putty"</em>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="plugin_dev">
					<h2>Creating own plugins</h2>
					<p>
						If you want to create your own plugins there is a <a href="DeveloperGuide.html">guide</a> available for you.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<!-- ====================== BUG REPORTING =================== -->
			<div id="bugreport">
				<h1>Reporting bugs</h1>
				<p>
					If you managed to crash Blitzy a window should appear that tells you that something went wrong and offers to send an error report
					to me. The text field will show you exactly what data will be send to me although I doubt you can do anything useful with this
					except checking if there are sensible information sent (which are not).

					Additionally you may enter an email address that can be used to contact you if further information is needed to fix your reported bug.
					This address won't be used for anything else than getting in touch with you if needed.

					If you don't want to send the report that's ok, but then you shouldn't complain that the error won't get fixed. I can't fix anything
					if I don't know it has to be fixed.
					If you sent the report I'll promise to do my best to fix the bug as soon as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					However if you find something that doesn't crash the program but should be fixed, changed or could be done better please please report
					an issue on the bug tracker. You'll find it at <a href="http://btbsoft.org/issues">http://btbsoft.org/issues</a>.
					Before creating a new issue, please perform a search to find out if the issue has already been reported by someone else.
